= Rules =

== Overview and Goal ==

You are a gigantic Monster willing to do anything to become King of Tokyo.
Your rampage brings you glory in the form of Victory Points (blue stars). To win, be the first Monster to gain 20 Victory Points.
Or, get your claws out and eliminate your enemies. The last one standing claims victory!

== Turn Overview ==
# Roll Dice
# Resolve Dice
# Enter Tokyo
# Buy Power cards
# End of turn

=== Roll Dice ===
'''On your turn, you can roll the dice up to three times. You can stop rolling any time.'''

On the first Roll, 6 dices are rolled. For your second Roll, if you like some of your results, you can set them aside (click on the to lock them) and only roll the ones you don’t like again.

For your third Roll, if you change your mind, you can roll any dice you set aside again (click on it to unlock it), along with any you still don’t like.

After you finish your three Rolls (or you decide to stop), continue to the Resolve Dice step.

== Resolve Dice ==
Symbols rolled at the end of your last die Roll represent the actions of your turn.

=== Victory points (dices 1, 2 and 3) ===
If you roll three-of-a-kind of 1, 2 or 3, gain as many points as the number.

Each additional die rolled with the same face gains you 1 additional point.

=== Energy (lightning bolt die) ===
Gain 1 energy from the pool for each energy die.

=== Heal (heart die) ===
If you are outside of Tokyo, you can gain 1 heart for each Heal die rolled. You cannot gain above 10 hearts.

If you are in Tokyo, the hearts you roll do not let you gain heart (you can only gain heart with Power cards).

=== Smash (hand die) ===
Monsters that are not in the same place as you lose 1 for each smash die rolled.

If you are in Tokyo (Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay) and you roll smash dices, you wound all Monsters outside of Tokyo.

If you are outside of Tokyo and you roll smash dices, you wound all Monsters who are in Tokyo (Tokyo City and Tokyo Bay). 
These Monsters can then decide to Yield and leave Tokyo or stay. Monsters who Yield Tokyo still lose hearts.
Each smash die results in losing one Life Point.
If a Monster loses his last Life Point, he is eliminated.

'''Since no Monster starts the game in Tokyo, the Monster who plays first does not cause Monsters to lose heart with smash dices.'''

Note : Lost heart from a Power card effect is different than smash dices. A Monster can only yield Tokyo when losing hearts from smash dice.

== Enter Tokyo ==

If no one is in Tokyo, you must enter and place your Monster in Tokyo City.
You can only Yield when you lose heart from smashes rolled by a Monster.

No Monster starts the game in Tokyo. The first player will always enter Tokyo City during this step.

=== 5/6 players ===
With 5 to 6 players, if Tokyo City is occupied, but Tokyo Bay is empty, you must enter Tokyo Bay. Monsters in Tokyo City and Tokyo Bay are both considered “in Tokyo”. Tokyo Bay has the same effects as Tokyo City.

Once the game has 4 or fewer players, you must leave Tokyo Bay immediately (except if Tokyo City is empty, in which case you move there).

=== Being in Tokyo (Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay) ===
has some advantages and disadvantages:
* You gain 1 point when you enter Tokyo.
* You gain 2 points if you start your turn in Tokyo.
* Monsters in Tokyo cannot use heart dice to heal

== Buy Power cards ==

You now may buy one or more of the three face-up cards. To buy a Power card, spend as many energy as the cost indicated at the top of the card. 
'''Replace bought cards immediately from the top of the deck. New cards are immediately available for purchase.'''

You can also spend 2 energy to sweep all three face-up cards to the discard. Then reveal three new Power cards from the deck. They are immediately available for purchase.

'''As long as you have enough energy, you can continue to buy or sweep cards.'''

== End of turn ==
Certain Power card effects activate at the end of your turn.

Once you’re done, pass the dice to the player on your left.

== Power card clarifications ==
* If you reach 20 points and reach 0 heart in the same turn because of a Power card, you are eliminated. You must survive your turn to win. If all Monsters are eliminated at the same time… everyone loses!
* Power cards do not let Monsters gain above 10 heart, unless a keep card says otherwise.

=== Opportunist ===
If there are two Opportunist in play (because of Mimic), the first Monster clockwise from the Monster whose turn it is gets first opportunity to buy newly revealed cards.

=== Fire Breathing ===
The Monsters of the players seated to your left and right each lose 1 heart. They lose this heart even if they are in the same place as you. If there are only 2 players, your opponent only loses 1 heart.

=== Mimic ===
Mimic copies the effects of a card as if it had just been played (with tokens, for example). If the copied card is discarded, Mimic no longer has an effect and you take back the associated token. You can place it on another Keep card at the start of your next turn (before you roll dice) by spending 1 energy.

=== Poison Spit & Shrink Ray ===
Poison and Shrink tokens stay even if their associated cards are discarded. You cannot remove these tokens while you are in Tokyo: you must be outside of Tokyo to use the heart die to remove tokens.

=== Metamorph ===
Discarding your Keep cards happens in the End of Turn step. You get back the full cost of the card as printed, even if you bought it at a discount.

= 2 players variant =
''This option is activated by default.''

* Instead of gaining 1 point when entering Tokyo, you gain 1 energy.
* Instead of gaining 2 points if you begin you turn in Tokyo, you gain 1 energy.

All other rules remain unchanged.

= Halloween version =
Halloween version adds a new Costume cards. Players choose one costume card at the begining of the game. It is possible to have multiple Costume cards, as the unused Costume cards are shuffled on the deck, and can be bought like any other card.

When a player rolls 3 smashes of more, he can steal Costume cards from players he damages (paying them the cost). He can steal several cards, from different players, at the same turn. Smash damage still apply when stealing cards is used.
